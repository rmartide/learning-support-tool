## Idea behind the project

I'm studying german and I have to review the words so to do it I use a .txt and it's annoying.

I want to do a simple app so I can:

* Add words (singular and plural), translations and phrases and gender

* Hide one of the two so you don't pick on the other one while reviewing

* Verbs and conjugation

* Categories (adjectives, prepositions, clothing, food...)

* Gramatical rules

* Declination of pronouns and adjectives

* Helpful links

In summary, a tool to learn a new language easier
